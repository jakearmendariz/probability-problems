# Probability in Python
Some projects that I developed this quarter based on my probability and statistics class at ucsc. Many classes are dependent on each other as parent and child classes, and can solve probability problems.

## Run
python3 main.py
This runs a basic user interface for finding the expected, variance of different random variables. To get more use out of each random variables. Create an instance of the object inside of the class, I have an example in each file of how to use it.

## Future
Adding Bayes theorem soon.
I want to try and find a way to classify probablity problems using machine learning, and solve them using these programs. Obviously that is a very hard problem to solve, especially with my limited experience, however I think it will be pretty cool, and from some research papers I read, somewhat possible. So stay tuned!
